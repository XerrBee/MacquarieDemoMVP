# MVP Mobile App Development - Deliverable 2



This application is an MVP(Multiple Viable Product) of a Macquarie University app proposal to benefit students, staff and visitors. The original figma design I designed has several transactions but in this MVP, I will be focusing on the CarPark functionality. This means that while I am going to create cards for all of the transactions category, I would only implement the Car Park function so don't panic if clicking on the other categories did nothing. My application here allows the user to navigate seamlessly into the Car Park Screen and support for local storage which will be saved in the local storage when the Book this slot button is pressed along with the total price. I have also provided support for dark mode and authentication(Login, Register, Logout) through Firebase.

Comments on how the design of your application differs from your Deliverable 1 design (if it does)
=> The login page design differs slightly from my original figma design in that I don't include the card/container with a border radius and just layed all the components down as it is. And I used a different sort of icon while in this design I used the default icon that comes with AppBar to go back to previous screens. My Navigation Bar is also more simplistic in this design however I do believe that I followed my original design to a reasonable extent for my Login and Register Page. As for the home, I decided that changing the cards to look the way it did now is better than doing two cards in one row just as I did before therefore I changed it. As for the description of each item, it looks fairly similar to my original design except for maybe the options where I choose how many hours to book for. The design's border radius is also now changed on the bottom right and bottom left of the images instead of how I did it in the first deliverable. Also I changed the items list part so that it is accessible through a scroll now instead of several items lining up in rows and columns and having to scroll down to check. I've also added the FAQ sections in the carpark screen and the small map container on the top which is also different from my original design.

Notes on the devices you have used to develop and test your application
=> Pixel 6 Pro API 33(The emulator went dead halfway through the assignment), Pixel 4 XL API 33, Chrome(Not very compatible with some of the elements with the positioning).
Any extra information the markers would need to evaluate your work.
=>The email address used is test@gmail.com and password is test123 for the login credentials.
Also I have included all the major screens widget tests and a few unit tests as well as one integration test.
