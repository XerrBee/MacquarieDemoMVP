# MVP Mobile App Development - Deliverable 2


Please include a README.md file containing: 

A brief summary of your application, target audience, main functionality
=> This application is an MVP(Multiple Viable Product) of a Macquarie University app proposal to benefit students, staff and visitors. The app has several transactions but in this MVP, I will be focusing on the CarPark functionality. 
Comments on how the design of your application differs from your Deliverable 1 design (if it does)
=> The login page design differs slightly from my original figma design in that I don't include the card/container with a border radius and just layed all the components down as it is. 
Notes on the devices you have used to develop and test your application
=> Pixel 6 Pro API 33
Any extra information the markers would need to evaluate your work.
