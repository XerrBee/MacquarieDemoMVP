# MVP Mobile App Development - Deliverable 2


Please include a README.md file containing: 

A brief summary of your application, target audience, main functionality
=> This application is an MVP(Multiple Viable Product) of a Macquarie University app proposal to benefit students, staff and visitors. The original figma design I designed has several transactions but in this MVP, I will be focusing on the CarPark functionality. My application here allows the user to navigate seamlessly into the Car Park Screen and support for local storage which will be saved in the local storage when the Book this slot button is pressed along with the total price. I also provided support for dark mode and authentication through Firebase.
Comments on how the design of your application differs from your Deliverable 1 design (if it does)
=> The login page design differs slightly from my original figma design in that I don't include the card/container with a border radius and just layed all the components down as it is. 
Notes on the devices you have used to develop and test your application
=> Pixel 6 Pro API 33(The emulator went dead halfway through the assignment), Pixel 4 XL API 33
Any extra information the markers would need to evaluate your work.
